## üêç Python & üìà Tableau  
### **Exploratory Data Analysis: Irish Accommodations Sector**  
Combining Python for data wrangling with Tableau for dashboarding, this project explores patterns in accommodation types and distribution across Ireland. The final outputs were visualised in a polished Tableau dashboard.

**Skills / Tools:**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Tableau
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)    
- Data Cleaning & Visualisation  
- Geo-Spatial Analysis
